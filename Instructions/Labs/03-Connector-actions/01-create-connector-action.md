# Create a connector tool

In this exercise, you will configure a connector tool for a declarative agent in Copilot Studio. You'll use the "SharePoint - List folder" connector to retrieve a list of files from a Products folder that contains product support files.

This exercise should take approximately **15** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

This exercise focuses on adding connector tools to an existing agent. This exercise assumes the following:

1. You've already created a **Product Support** declarative agent in Copilot Studio. If you need instructions for creating a declarative agent, see: [Create a declarative agent](../01-Build-your-first-declarative-agent/01-create-declarative-agent.md).

1. You have a SharePoint site titled **Product Support** that contains a document library named **Products** containing files with sample product-related data. For instructions, see the section titled **Before you start** within the exercise: [Add custom knowledge](../01-Build-your-first-declarative-agent/02-add-custom-knowledge.md).

## Create a SharePoint connector tool from a prebuilt connector

Create a connector tool using the SharePoint List Folder prebuilt connector and add it to the agent.

1. In your web browser, navigate to [Copilot Studio](https://www.copilotstudio.microsoft.com) at `https://www.copilotstudio.microsoft.com`.

1. If Copilot Studio opens in the new experience, locate the **New experience** toggle in the upper-right corner of the page and turn it off to return to the classic experience. On the **Submit feedback to Microsoft** dialog, select **Submit** > **Done** to close it. If Copilot Studio opens in the classic experience, skip this step.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, verify that the Environment Selector shows the environment you created for this lab. If it shows the default environment, select the Environment Selector, then select the environment you created.

1. In the sidebar, select **Agents**.

1. Select **Microsoft 365 Copilot**.

1. Under **Agents**, select your **Product Support** agent.

1. Under **Tools**, select **+ Add tool**.

1. In the **Add tool** dialog, select the **Connector** button to filter for Connector tools, then enter `SharePoint` in the **Search** bar and select **Search** or press **Enter**. Wait for relevant connectors to be displayed in the window.

1. Browse and select the **List Folder** SharePoint connector.

1. The modal window displays a connection for the SharePoint connector. A green checkmark will be displayed next to the connector when your connection is active. You may select the **...** to view details about the connection. If the status is **Not connected**, select the dropdown next to **Not connected** and select **Create new connection**.

1. On the **Connect to SharePoint** dialog, select **Connect directly (cloud services)**, then select **Create**.

1. You will be prompted to sign in. Sign in using the M365 account you're using for the exercise.

1. On the **Add tool** dialog, after a connection is established, select **Add and configure** to add the tool to your agent.

1. Confirm that the **List folder - connector** tool is listed in the **Tools** section of your agent.

## Configure the connector tool for your agent

Configure the properties of the connector tool for the agent.

1. From the **Product Support** agent page, under **Tools**, select the **List folder - connector** tool you added in the previous section.

1. In the **Name** text box, enter `List product support files`.

1. In the **Description** text box, enter `List product support files available in the Products folder`.

1. Select the toggle next to **Additional details** to reveal additional properties.

1. In the **Description** text box in the **Additional details** section, enter `Please log in to access the Product Support SharePoint site`.

1. In the **Inputs** section, locate the **Site Address** input.

1. In the **Value** text box, select your **Product Support** SharePoint site from the drop-down, or select **Enter custom value** and enter the URL in the format `https://DOMAIN.sharepoint.com/sites/ProductSupport`.

1. Next, locate the **File Identifier** input. Set the **Fill using** field to **Custom**.

1. In the **Value** text box for **File Identifier**, enter `Products`.

1. Select **Save** at the top of the page to save your changes.
   
## Modify the agent's instructions

Let's also update your agent's instructions, providing guidance to the agent for how to use the connector tool.

1. Return to the overview page for your **Product Support** agent.

1. From the **Details** section of your **Product Support** agent in Copilot Studio, select **Edit**.

1. In the **Instructions** text box, add the following to the existing instructions text: `When asked about available support resources, use the SharePoint connector to list the files in the Products folder and let the user know the SharePoint Connector was used.`

1. Select **Save**.

## Test your agent with the tool

1. Expand the **Test your agent** pane on the right side of your agent's detail page.

1. Select the **New chat** button in the test pane to load your agent's latest changes.

1. In the message box, enter `What product support files are available?`, then send the message.

1. If you're prompted with a **Connect to continue** message, select **Allow** to let the agent use your credentials to connect to SharePoint.

1. Notice that your agent responds with a comment about the connector that was used, as instructed, and lists the files available in the Products folder.

You've validated that your connector tool works as expected within your agent and completed this exercise.
