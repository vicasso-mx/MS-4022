# Create a prompt action

In this exercise you will create a prompt action, test the prompt in Copilot Studio, and test the prompt within a Copilot agent. You'll create a prompt action that helps users turn their raw ideas into organized marketing pitches that follow a specific format and guidelines.

This exercise should take approximately **15** minutes to complete.

## Create a custom prompt in Copilot Studio

1. Open Copilot Studio in your web browser by navigating to [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com) at `https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com`.

1. If Copilot Studio opens in the new experience, locate the **New experience** toggle in the upper-right corner of the page and turn it off to return to the classic experience. On the **Submit feedback to Microsoft** dialog, select **Submit** > **Done** to close it. If Copilot Studio opens in the classic experience, skip this step.

1. In the upper-right corner of the page, verify that the Environment Selector shows the environment you created for this lab. If it shows the default environment, select the Environment Selector, then select the environment you created.

1. Select **Tools** from the left navigation.

1. Select **+ New tool**.

1. On the **New tool** dialog box, select **Prompt**. You're taken to the prompt builder UI. Copilot is available within this window, but you'll define the prompt manually for this exercise.

1. In the textbox at the top of the window, select the auto-generated name and replace it with the name `Marketing Pitch Prompt`.

1. In the **Instructions** text box, enter `Create a marketing pitch for a product based on a `.
1. Place your cursor at the end of the sentence you entered, then select **Add content**.

1. Select **Text**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter `Draft`.

1. In the **Sample data** field, enter `The Mighty Mechanical Pencil is new, exciting, and useful. It's not only the first of its kind pencil, but it's fun to use.` then select **Close**.

## Test and refine your prompt

1. Select **Test** above the instructions box to test the prompt with the sample data you provided.

1. View the output of the test run in the **Model response** section.

   Let's refine the prompt to create more structured and consistent output.

1. In the **Instructions** text box, add the following to the existing instructions to modify the prompt:

    ```plaintext
    The pitch should follow the following Contoso guidelines:
       - Start with a brief hook
       - Describe unique value proposition
       - End with a call-to-action
       - Use an exciting and influential tone
    ```

1. Select **Test** again to retest the prompt.

1. Notice how the response differs.

1. Select **Save** to save the prompt.

## (Optional) Add a prompt action to an agent

### Add the prompt tool

1. From the sidebar in Copilot Studio, select **Agents**.

1. Select **Microsoft 365 Copilot**.

1. Under **Agents**, select the **Product Support** agent you'd like to add the action to.

1. From the **Tools** section of the page, select **Add tool**.

1. Select the **Prompt** filter.

1. Select the **Marketing Pitch Prompt** tool.

### Update the agent's instructions and starter prompts

Update the agent's instructions to provide guidance for using the prompt.

1. In the **Details** section, select **Edit**.

1. In the **Instructions** text box, add the following text to the existing instructions: `Use the Marketing Pitch Prompt tool to craft pitches for products that follow Contoso guidelines based on users' draft ideas.`

1. Select **Save** to save your changes.

1. In the **Suggested prompts** section, replace the Eagle Air suggested prompt with the following suggested prompt and then **Save** your changes: `Marketing Pitch` : `Create a marketing pitch following Contoso guidelines based on the following draft:`.

You've completed the exercise and created a prompt tool for your agent.
